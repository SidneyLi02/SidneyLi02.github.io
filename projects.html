    <p1>Below is a list of my projects in mostly chronological order. Most of my projects listed below can be
        found on my Github, whether private or public. </p1>

        <div>
            <ul><h3><u>Coca-Cola Can Piano</u></h3></ul>
                <p1>This was a project made in APCSA in the 11th grade. A piano spanning 
                    an octave was created using Java, Arduino's CapactiativeSense Library, breadboard, jumper wires,
                    and various other electrical components. </p1>
        </div>

        <div>
            <ul><h3><u>Personal Website</u></h3></ul>
                <p1>This website will house and develop my HTML and CSS skills. I hope to beautify this website
                and add a multitude of features in the coming years. </p1>
        </div>

        <div>
            <ul><h3><u>Portfolio Tracker</u></h3></ul>
                <p1>This project is somewhat influenced by my mother as she has taken a recent liking to watching
                    economics and finance videos, and has begun investing in mutual funds herself through CIBC. This project
                    uses the standard web-scraping libraries (BS4, requests), standard data visualization libraries
                    (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib), and miscellaneous other libraries (datetime, timezone). The main library 
                    is YFinance, and it is based upon the aforementioned libraries, as it draws upon Yahoo Finance's data.
                </p1>

                <br>
                <br>

                <p1>This will be my first solo project of this scale, it will be a continuous project until
                    I am satisfied with its completed state. Final product will be solely for personal use.</p1>

    <p1>I will be attending or have attended the following hackathons. Information will be posted under the respective
        hackathon detailing my contribution and project presented. If nothing was created, I will write a short description
        of the technologies I have learned and will put to use in future endeavors.</p1>

    <div>
        <ul><h3><u>HackMIT 2020</u></h3></ul>
