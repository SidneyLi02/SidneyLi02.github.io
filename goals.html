    <h1>Goals</h1>
    <p1>Here are my three main goals for the coming school year.</p1>
    <ol>
        <li>Get an amazing co-op job!</li>
        <li>Get on the Dean's List!</li>
        <li>Be financially independent!</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>I strive to improve my pythonic abilities, mostly webscraping data and modelling. 
        After putting off learning HTML and CSS for 5 years, I have finally started learning on June 16, 2020.
