    <p1>There is nothing special here to see here as of yet. I will be probably pursuing some data science projects.</p1>
    <p2>This is my <a href="https://github.com/SidneyLi02/" target="_blank">Github</a>. For the time being, all my repositories except my website are private.</p2>
    <p3>
        My favourite <a target="_blank" href="http://wikipedia.org"> website</a> to dive deep into the rabbit hole.

    <p>Any suggestions or want to get to know me better? I have attached a form submission below but it will go nowhere as of now.</p>

                <p class="text-indent">I will be entering the University of Waterloo this coming fall 2020 in the Honours Bachelor of Mathematics 
                (University of Waterloo) and Honours Bachelor of Business Administration (Wilfrid Laurier University) double degree program. 
                I have started this website as a means to display my side projects and their progress. I have picked up programming after being in
                an "on and off" phase for the past 5 years. This, in effect, is an acknowledgement that computing skills are necessary in the workforce.           
                I plan to pursue a career in either management consulting, banking, or financial services. However, it is quite tentative as my 
                interests may and will definitely change. </p>
